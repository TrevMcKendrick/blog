title: Why Vesper will Succeed
---
<p>Today John Gruber, Dave Wiskus, and Brent Simmons launched a thought collection app called <a href="http://vesperapp.co/">Vesper</a>. As I write this it&#8217;s holding strong at #68 Overall for iPhone Gross Ranking. I estimate it will pay for itself (i.e. time invested) within a week or two.

<p>It&#8217;s a well-made app. The design is very &#8220;flat&#8221; relative to other current iOS development (maybe someone has a sneak peak on iOS 7?). My favorite part is the Credits view; instead of an about page, they made a movie-poster style information view, complete with tagline and all-caps credits at the bottom. John Gruber's touch is all over this thing.</p>

<p>The app will undoubtably be a success and these guys deserve it.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s talk about <em>why</em> it will be successful. </p>

<p>I almost threw up in my mouth reading <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/06/vesper">Marco Arment describe the &#8220;balls&#8221;</a> it took to make Vesper. </p>

<p>$4.99. Crowded market. Notes app with no sync or export. Abstract icon. Sure.</p>

<p>My issue is that these guys could have released a polished app of <em>anything</em> and they would have succeeded. They could have charged $9.99. They could have made a freaking todo list or flashlight app, and people would buy it.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><strong>Because we all know about it</strong></p>

<p>Distribution and our attention. That&#8217;s what they have that most iOS devs don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a huge competitive advantage, but <em>nobody talks about it.</em></p>

<p>Instead we gush on about how it&#8217;s a great app and well designed ad nauseum. We admire it as a piece of artwork and think because it&#8217;s good art it makes good business, too.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s the wrong thing to admire about Vesper. While a great app, yes, there are many great apps that don&#8217;t go anywhere.</p>

<p>What we should be talking about is how John Gruber, <em>for a decade</em>, has been <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">writing and thinking and adding</a> commentary to the Apple ecosystem. He has a massive audience and he&#8217;s earned the attention of every single one of his readers.</p>

<p>What we should be talking about is how Brent Simmons has written <a href="http://inessential.com/">great software</a> since as long as we can all remember. His commitment to consistently make wonderful things has earned him the trust of much of the developer community and he deserves it. </p>

<p>What we should be talking about is how Dave Wiskus helped grow <a href="http://blackpixel.com/">Black Pixel</a> to be one of the best known iOS and Mac agencies in the world. This too has earned him the attention and respect of many people like you and me.</p>

<p>These men all deserve the success Vesper will enjoy. But let&#8217;s recognize that it will succeed not because of a few interesting design decisions and the work of the past few months.</p>

<p>Instead, we&#8217;d do ourselves better by remembering that the <strong>real work</strong> is <em>being great</em> &#8211; whatever that means in your field &#8211; over <em>long periods of time</em>. That is what earns you the trust of an audience, and that is why these three have succeeded.</p>
