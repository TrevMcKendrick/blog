**Summary**  
Inside story of the 2012 presidential election.

If you enjoy politics and wonder what happens behind the scenes during elections you will thoroughly enjoy this book. 

Highlight:
- the list of potential Republican candidates. It was fascinating that some men said they didn't run, even with tons of powerful support, because they were happy and satisfied with their current lives. 
- Obama and Romney both expressing how much they dislike political debates. Seeing them talk you'd have no idea. 
- How close Obama was to botching the 2nd debate worse than the first. His practice runs the day before were terrible
- Romney couldn't buy a break. While his team definitely made mistakes, it seemed the worst possible consequences always followed. His team even had a phrase for it: "Mitt happens."
- The nature of Utah's beloved former Governor Huntsman: barely wealthy (net worth of $10 million), and super (but stupidly) political. Instead of banding with the more likely Mormon candidate, he turned on Romney as soon as he saw even a remote benefit to himself to do so

It appears the writers had great access, and the book's truthfulness has been vouched by some who have insider info.

I still took a lot of it with a grain of salt, but it definitely gives a solid understanding of what the presidential campaign looks like from the inside
