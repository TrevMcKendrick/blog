**One Sentence Summary**  
The inside story of Twitter, from founding to IPO.

**Details**  
Just fantastic.

Everyone talks about how messed up Twitter was, but I had no idea how deep that went until reading this book.

I think the *only* thing Twitter got right was the product. Because everything else was a disaster, hidden from the view of the public. [[^1]]

Of note: Jack Dorsey wrote the book on building a  personal brand. When he was pushed out of Twitter he was given the title of "President" so no one on the outside knew what had happened. 

And since no one knew, Dorsey did hundreds of talks and interviews, telling the story of how he "invented" Twitter, of how he's been thinking about these ideas since he was a child.

At best, the real story was much more complicated than how Jack tells it. At worst, his version was complete bullshit. As usual, the Truth is probably somewhere in between. But Jack's story alone makes this worth reading.

But we also find out:
- how the board fired Ev Williams
- Biz Stone convinced his wife to let him leave millions in options at Google to follow Ev and start Odio. What a career move!
- Bijan Sabet sent the most epic reply all failure of all time, basically telling Jack he was getting kicked out

**Would you like it?**  

If you want a decent (albeit not perfect) look on the inside of one of the most notable tech companies of our time, you would probably enjoy this book.

[^1]: It's very possible (likely?) that *all* successful startups are as bad as Twitter, for as long as Twitter was. If that's the case, the lesson of "get the product right and everything else takes care of itself" is all the more accurate.
