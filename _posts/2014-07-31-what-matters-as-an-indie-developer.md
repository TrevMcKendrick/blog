title: What Matters as an Indie Developer
category: blog
---

There's lots of [stories](http://www.marco.org/2014/07/28/app-rot) lately in the [tech world](http://txt.jazzychad.net/gist/19a05ad4e7ef77072b44) about how [hard](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year) it is as an indie iOS developer.

And it's true: stories often discuss how much competition exists (true), how Apple needs to improve App Store discovery (true), or how prices are falling to practically zero (also true).

But I think those valid concerns obfuscate something more important, which is: 

*What can indie developers actually do?*
<hr>

What's the difference between a terrible movie with amazing effects (see *[Transformers 4](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/transformers_age_of_extinction/)*) and a cheaper classic like *[Good Will Hunting](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/good_will_hunting/)*?

The story.

It's the story that moves us, makes us laugh, makes us tell our friends.

The story is **the thing people want**.

It's why people can love *The Simpsons* or *Family Guy* and be disappointed by [the beautiful *Cars 2*](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cars_2/).

The effects, props, location, editing, appearance, etc. might amplify a [great story](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzt3vb_paperman_shortfilms), but they can't fix a poor one.

Craigslist is *The Simpsons* of Internet businesses. 

It doesn't look great, but people love it anyway because it solves their problems.

It works for the same reasons guys like [Joel Grasmeyer](https://twitter.com/grasmeyer) and [Michael Love](https://twitter.com/elkmovie) can make a very good living (and then some) solving problems for [specific](http://www.realestatetools.com/propertyevaluator/) [niches](http://www.pleco.com/).

I wouldn't be surprised if there were many more iOS indie developers out there, quietly making a living solving the problems of some unsexy niche.

Like the story in a movie or TV show, the problem your app solves is what matters most.

And thankfully, that's one of the few things over which developers have absolute control.
