My first success as an entrepreneur (and admittedly a small one) was too easy.

<hr>

My Spanish Bible apps make about [$100k a year](http://www.trevormckendrick.com/My-2nd-Year-in-the-App-Store/), but that number isn't going to increase significantly from here, and who knows how long it'll last.

And while I can enjoy the freedom they provide me now, they aren't going to make me wealthy. I need something else if I want financial independence.

So the past 6 months I've been looking for things to make.

<hr>

My process for deciding on my Spanish Bible apps is [well documented](http://www.trevormckendrick.com/how-to-choose-a-profitable-niche/). It was pretty easy to see how much revenue my (incredibly crappy) competitors were making, and to assume I could make something better.

All I had to do was make the app and put it on the App Store. Seriously. I didn't even tweet about it.

The Spanish Bible apps required zero marketing. Zero customer validation. Zero cold calls.

And In two months I was making $6,000 a month, with almost zero expenses.

I was spoiled.

<hr>

In the past 6 months I've built two products: [EverHaven](https://everhavenhq.com/) and [Ticket Science](https://ticketscience.com/). They've had small inquiries but neither has found a single customer. They are derivative of larger, existing companies where I was hoping a local focus would give me enough of a wedge to differentiate.

Of course I made the enormous mistake of not reaching out about the products until they launched. What a noob. [[^1]]

And now I'm in Monterrey, Mexico, looking for problems to solve, since I'm one of the relatively few people who speaks Spanish, knows the tech scene, and can make stuff on my own. I hoped the same opportunity that I found with Spanish Bibles would be in other industries in Mexico.

I haven't been here very long, but whatever I was looking for isn't as obvious as I'd hoped it would be.

In fact now that I'm here, I'm even less sure of how to look for it.

In searching for problems I stumbled upon [Capterra](http://www.capterra.com/), which has been nothing short of depressing.

 Capterra shows pretty much all the SAAS web apps out there, organized by every industry imaginable. It definitely make me *feel* the opposite of Paul Graham's ["there's always room."](http://paulgraham.com/startuplessons.html)

I know starting and growing a business that can creates jobs, wealth, and independence is really hard. Being spoiled made me think, for a brief moment, that I just might be able to beat the system.

But I can't. 

Solving real problems, finding real customers, and bringing in real revenue is just plain hard.

If you want to make a million dollars, you have to go through a million dollars of pain.

[^1]: I have to let myself off the hook a little since a lot of the motivation for building both was to continue practicing Rails. It's definitely been successful in that regard.
