**Summary**  
*The Passage of Power* covers the time from Lyndon B. Johnson's failed presidential campaign in 1960 to his first State of the Union address 7 weeks after JFK's assassination. It's the fourth of a five book series on LBJ.

**Details**  
I didn't know anything about LBJ before this book other than hearing about "the Johnson treatment" and that he gets much of the blame for the Vietnam War.

So the book taught me a lot.  For example, he was *the* guy in the Senate, as Majority leader, from 1948 until 1960. He was a master politician with a ton of legitimate power.

He lost most of that power when he became Kennedy's Vice President in 1960. In fact, those 3 years as VP were some of the worst for LBJ. Before JFK died there were even rumors he wouldn't ask Johnson to be on the '64 ticket. Johnson had stopped being invited to meetings. He had gone from leader of the legislative branch to a has been in the executive.

I also learned that Johnson embodied everything we hate about politicians. He lied constantly and to everyone. He got rich by using political power to get radio and tv license monopolies in his homestate of Texas. He actively controlled business assets that had been placed in a blind trust when he was President by installing private telephone lines in the Oval Office and the White House.

But he was also the guy who passed Civil Rights. Even FDR, with all the liberal power a president could ask for, couldn't get Civil Rights done. LBJ got it passed within 8 months of becoming President. When he had power he knew how to use it.

The book is fascinating. Robert Caro is a fantastic biographer and fills the book with deeply interesting and detailed stories.

**Recommendation**  
If you enjoy reading about politics, great men, or biographies of famous people, you will be hard pressed to find a better book. If you don't typically enjoy non-fiction, or if politics bores or frustrates you, I'd pass on this one.
