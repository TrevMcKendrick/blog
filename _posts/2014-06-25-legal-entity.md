title: The Quickest Advice You'll Find on Choosing a Business Entity
category: blog

I don't really tell people about it, but I actually have a Master's degree in accounting. I'm not sure I would do it again (if it's not obvious, I'm not an accountant any more!) but thankfully it was only a 1-year program and the tuition was relatively cheap at around $10,000.

That said, this is my big chance to actually make use of the degree: giving quick, easy tips on how to pick a legal entity for your business! *My lawyer made me write this: I'm not a lawyer or a CPA, so don't take this as legal advice. Before making a decision you should consult proper counsel*

**Is it worth the hassle?**  
Figuring out which legal entity to create for your business is boring, but important. If you're going to do it, you might as well take a little extra time to do it right. 

First thing's first: *why do I even want to make a legal entity in the first place?*  For most SMB owners, the most important reason is to limit your personal liability.

You could instead operate as a **sole proprietor**, but then you may be personally liable for all debts and claims against the business.

For example, if your business lost a lawsuit for $500,000 and your sole proprietorship was only worth $100,000, the prosecutor could potentially take your personal assets (home, car, etc.) to pay the remaining $400,000.

If you'd created a separate entity, generally only your investment in that entity would be exposed. 

Given how cheap and easy it is to set up an LLC (more on that below), there's very few times it's worth operating as a sole proprietor.

**What are my choices?**  
So assuming you don't want to be a sole proprietor, here are your options in the US:

**C corporation**  
**S corporation (S corp)**  
**Limited liability company (LLC)**  

**C corporation**  
Practically all companies on the stock market (Facebook, Google, Wal-Mart, etc.) are C corporations. 

C corporations are generally for companies that plan to raise money from investors, issue stock options to employees, and eventually go public. They allow you to have any number of investors, whether individuals or other legal entities, who can be from anywhere in the world.

But you also have to pay more legal costs to get started, file a ton of additional paperwork, have and keep track of board meetings, and, possibly worst of all, you'll be "double taxed."

"Double taxation" refers to when both the company itself and its shareholders pay taxes on income.

For example, a company like Apple makes a profit and pays a corporate tax on that income. But if you bought shares in Apple and they issued a dividend, you'd have to pay tax on that dividend, too. So both the entity itself and its shareholders pay tax on the same income.

C corporations are the only entity which require double taxation.

*Recommended if:*  
- You're doing a startup  
- You're raising money from many investors (or from foreign invesetors)  
- You plan to issue stock options to employees  

*Not a good fit if:*  
- You don't want a more complicated and expensive setup process  
- You don't want to pay taxes twice on your business income  
- You don't want to have board meetings and keep minutes  


**S Corporation (S corp)**  
Creating an S corp requires the same work as creating a C corporation, plus an extra step: all shareholders must sign and file [Form 2553](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2553.pdf).

Why an S corp when it's an extra step? The main benefit is there is *no* double taxation.

There are a few drawbacks. Mainly, S corps can have only up to 100 shareholders. And those shareholders can't be non-US citizens or non-US residents.

*Recommended if:*  
- You want to sell stock in your business without being double taxed  
- You want the business to live on even if a shareholder sells his shares or leaves the comapny

*Not a good fit if:*  
- You plan to go public  
- You have foreign investors  
- You want to avoid expensive and complicated setup


**Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)**  
Frankly, if you're just starting your first business you could probably setup an LLC and be fine. Even Facebook, which is now a C corporation, was [originally setup as an LLC in Florida](http://gawker.com/5643915/mark-zuckerberg-describes-the-dirty-tricks-that-led-to-the-facebook-movie). 

LLC's are a lot cheaper and simpler to start (a couple hundred bucks, depending on the state), provide more flexibilty, and give personal liability protection.

The main downside of an LLC is that, by default, *all net income* is subject to self-employment taxes.

(The good news is that you can make an S corp election so that only your salary is subjected to self-employment tax. The rest of your net income is considered a "distribution" and taxed at capital gains rates, if at all. But that's worthy of a separate post.)

An LLC is recommended if:  
- You want the simplest and cheapest way to limit your liability  
- You want the most flexibility  
- You don't plan to sell stock  

Not a good fit if:  
- You want the ability to sell "shares" in your company without getting the approval of other shareholders  
- You plan to raise money from investors beyond friends and family  

**How Do I Setup my Entity?**  
Every state has their own process and fees required to setup an entity. There's many services that will do this for you, but my favorite is [LegalZoom](http://www.legalzoom.com).

They can do lots of other legal stuff, too, but they're great for setting up your business. They know how to handle each state, file all the appropriate documents, etc. 

**Run Your Business**  
Like many things in running a business, picking which entity is something that you shouldn't get stuck on. Do your research, talk to a CPA or a lawyer if you like, then make the decision and move on.

I've never heard someone say "my business would have done great if only I'd make a better legal entity decision."

So get it all setup and move on with your life and business!
