title: Why is Everyone like Their Parents?
category: blog
---

Why do so many people end up in the same socioeconomic place as their parents? There’s at least two reasons I can think of.[2]

**First**, it’s easier to accomplish something when you’ve seen someone else do it.  

To use a popular example: many thought the human body could not run a mile in less than four minutes until [Roger Bannister][1] did it in 1954. But once he had shown it was possible, two months later two other runners did it in the same race.

That's probaby not a coincidence.

It’s the same with being raised by parents who are successful. You can probably think back to specific memories of your parents working, whether that's making stuff on the computer, phone calls with coworkers/partners, whatever.

If your parents are successful, you've seen the thousands of baby steps that go into, say, running a business, or creating something new. It's not some mystical, ether-like idea.

On the other hand, if you've never seen someone go to college you probably don't have a great idea how the application process works. How thorough does the application have to be filled out? What are colleges really looking for?

It's hard being the first to do basically anything.

**Second,** I think everyone has what I call an "**internal productivity quota**" (IPQ). Your IPQ is the amount of stuff you need to accomplish so you feel happy and productive instead of lazy and depressed. 

IPQ levels are different in everyone. They help explain (part of) the reason why people who don't need money continue to work so hard: they'd feel unproductive if they didn't.

Like other human behavior I think IPQ's are a function of nature and nurture. I believe humans tend to fall and rise to the average behavior of the people around them.

If we spend our time with people who don’t do well in school, don’t have jobs, and watch a lot of TV, our IPQ will adjust down. We won't be as productive, but over time that will feel okay because it's what everyone else is doing.

On the flip side if we’re around friends who wake up at 6 to hit the gym and work a disciplined 12 hour day, our IPQ will slowly adjust up. We'll feel the difference.

So to answer the question in the post title, most people end up like their parents because no one else has as large an influence on one's IPQ.

And because our parents probably chose to live in a place with people similar to them, practically everyone you knew growing up was the same way, too. It can be difficult to break out and do something different after being surrounded for 18 years by the same type of people.

The practical takeaway to all this? Choose friends that will make you better and inspire you! 

Obviously don't be a jerk or actively push "unambitious" people away. But do make time for people who are interested in the things you aspire to build and create.
