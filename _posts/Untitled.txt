Assumptions 

You ever notice how, when you try to make a quick left turn in front of on coming traffi, the cars coming towards you don't slow down? 

They assume you'll make the turn just fine. 

I lived in Oaxaca, Mexico for two years. They have traffic laws in the state, but unlike here very few people follow them (footnote about bumps as stop signs). They're hardly enforced. 

The result is that everyone is extremely conscious of their driving. No one assumes that, say, a green light means it's safe to cross. Or that a car turning in front of you is definitely going to make it without you slowing down.
