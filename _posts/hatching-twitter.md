Just fantastic.

I think the *only* thing Twitter got right was the product. Because everything else was a disaster, hidden from the view of the public. 

Jack Dorsey wrote the book on building a  personal brand. When he was pushed out of Twitter he was given the title of "President", so no one on the outside knew what had happened. 

And since no one knew, Dorsey did hundreds of talks and interviews, telling the story of how he "invented" Twitter, of how he's been thinking about these ideas since he was a child. It was all bullshit, but he told a great story and massively leveraged Twitter for his personal brand. 

In fact, Dorsey started Square before any of this came to light, so it's possible that his Square investors (none of whom were Twitter investors!) had no idea of his (lack of) position at Twitter. 

Jack's story alone makes this worth reading. 

But we also find out:
- how the board fired Ev Williams
- Biz Stone convinced his wife to let him leave millions in options at Google to follow Ev and start Odio. What a career move!
- Bijan Sabet sent the most epic reply all failure of all time, basically telling Dorsey he was getting kicked out

I assume most of this is pretty standard in any successful VC deal. But it's great to get an inside look.
