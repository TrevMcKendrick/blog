So you're selling tickets

- welcome email, **you're in the club**
- Teach your customer. Once a week is good.
- Send offers **based on your email data**

For example: people who open and ready every email are obviously more likely to make another purchase. They should be sent an upsell.

People who haven't opened a single one might be great potential customers, but they might have forgotten about you. Or maybe their friend signed them up and put in their email address. 

The point is, the same email should not go to both the active reader of your email and someone who hasn't read a single one.

But instead what people do all the time (I'm looking at you, Active) is blast out a single email to *everyone*. 

Email fatigue is a real thing. And so every email you send is a withdrawal from your brand with that customer.

Can you imagine Tiffany sending email upsells? Or Lamborghini? Why don't they? Because people don't like getting emails. It can damage a brand.

So if you're going to send emails, make sure they're worth your readers' time. Use that demographic data.

Mailchimp alone provides *tons* of data out of the box, for free: how often they open emails, how often they respond, their location, the last time they opened an email, where they signed up for your emails, their language, etc.

You can also match your email list with your customer list. Did someone run in 3 of your 4 events in Oklahoma, and the 4th event is coming in 2 months? That customer should be getting an email from you with an offer.

All of this works and your customers read your email because you are teaching them. "But I run Color Me Rad, what could I possibly teach my customers?" This is where you need to be creative and think orthogonaly. What is not related to running or 5ks that your demographic is still uniquely interested in?
