<p>This is the second of ten blog posts about my first year in the App Store. You can read the <a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/my-first-year-in-the-app-store/">first post here</a>.</p>

<p>I had over 1,800 people sign up to receive these posts via email, so thank you.</p>

<p><strong>A Spanish Bible? Really?</strong></p>

<p>Paul Graham said <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html">"make something people want"</a>. So I looked around in the App Store for things that customers were already downloading and paying for.</p>

<p>The best way</p>

<p>I need to start by describing my philosophy on marketing. Many people have asked “how do you find users?” or “what’s your marketing plan?” so let me get this out of the way:</p>

<p><em>I don’t do marketing. I make something users are already searching for.</em></p>

<p>It’s not a secret but what many don’t realize is that the #1 sales channel for the App Store is user search. Not paid ads, not email, not viral videos. Those others things help boost sales once you’ve found product/market fit but initially if you’re not getting sales via search your app is likely DOA.</p>

<h1><strong>A Framework for Evaluating Potential Niches</strong></h1>

<p>In choosing my niche I looked through <em>a lot</em> of apps. I mulled through every category, read tons of app reviews, etc.</p>

<p>While evaluating all these apps I came up with a framework to describe the “ideal” niche.</p>

<p>The ideal niche is:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Profitable</li>
    <li>Found via frequently search keyword phrases that don’t have crowded search results</li>
    <li>Not occupied by awesome apps (i.e. the competition sucks)</li>
</ol>

<p>Below I go into more detail about how I evaluate each of the three areas.</p>

<p><strong>1. Is the niche profitable?</strong></p>

<p>The App Store is a very unique marketplace because Apple provides the public rough but useful information about <strong>how much money businesses are making</strong>.</p>

<p>Think about all other businesses: grocery markets, conference organizers, retailers, general contractors, etc… you have no idea how how much revenue any of those businesses bring in. Which industry should I get involved in if I don’t know which ones make the most money?</p>

<p><em>Gross Ranking</em></p>

<p>The App Store solves this by providing Gross Ranking. For the unfamiliar, Apple ranks all apps by how much revenue they’re bringing in, both for the entire App Store as well as by each category.</p>

<p>This means if an app has a Gross Ranking it’s making some money. How much money? Depends on the category of the app and obviously the ranking itself. The more competitive the category (e.g. photography) the more money an app is making compared to an app in a less competitive category (e.g. weather) with the same Gross Ranking.</p>

<p>We can look up historical Gross Rankings using AppFigures.</p>

<p><em>AppFigures</em></p>

<p>I use <a href="appfigures.com">AppFigures</a> to look up apps’ entire ranking histories. They can tell an app’s story. Here’s two examples:</p>

<p>Calzy
<a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Calzy-AppFigures-Gross-history.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" alt="Calzy - AppFigures Gross history" src="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Calzy-AppFigures-Gross-history.png" width="927" height="703" /></a></p>

<p>Hunt Pro
<a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hunt-Pro-AppFigures-Gross-history.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" alt="Hunt Pro - AppFigures Gross history" src="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hunt-Pro-AppFigures-Gross-history.png" width="925" height="706" /></a></p>

<p>Calzy is likely to get lost once it’s no longer featured, while it appears Hunt Pro has built a business off of search alone. That’s the kind of information we’re looking for.</p>

<p>Now, to use Gross Ranking to estimate daily revenue we’ll use a post written by Distimo, another app analytics firm.</p>

<p><em>Distimo</em></p>

<p>Last May I posted <a href="http://www.quora.com/iOS-App-Store/How-many-App-Store-downloads-are-there-for-the-top-25-Paid-apps-in-each-category">a question to Quora</a> asking how many downloads it takes a <strong>paid app</strong> to rank in the top 25 of <strong>each category</strong>. E.g. roughly how many downloads does the #25 Paid Business iPhone app get in a day?</p>

<p>I tweeted it out to a (former) Distimo data analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/gert_jan">Gert Jan Spriensma</a>:</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/TrevMcKendrick/status/202179609385648129</p>

<p>He was nice enough to write <a href="http://www.distimo.com/blog/2012_05_quora-answering-series-download-volume-needed-to-hit-top-25-per-category/">an awesome post</a> which then got <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/16/how-many-daily-downloads-does-it-take-to-reach-the-top-of-the-app-store/">picked up by TechCrunch</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the all important chart from his post:
<a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Distimo-Chart.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1132" alt="Distimo Chart" src="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Distimo-Chart.png" width="627" height="352" /></a></p>

<p>This data is a year old now, (for those checking dates, I used this post to make decisions about my 2nd app, the audiobook, but not the first) but it tells us that, for example, the #25 Paid Business Category iPhone app gets roughly 90 downloads a day.</p>

<p>This is useful but ultimately what we want is Gross, not Paid, Rankings. To convert it we’ll just need to find some well ranking Business apps and do a little math.</p>

<p>The Business apps we’re looking for will need to be paid apps with no IAP’s that have an average Paid Ranking of roughly #25. It doesn’t have to be exactly #25… we’re just trying to estimate here. But the closer the better.</p>

<p>I was able to find two such apps in the Business category. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents/id295798315?mt=8">Documents</a>.</p>

<p>According to Distimo the #25 Paid Ranking Business app gets ~90 downloads a day. So with a little math we can estimate how much an app with a certain Gross Ranking in the Business category is making. See the AppFigures screenshots below for details.</p>

<p>This is PDF Expert’s <strong>Paid</strong> Ranking:

And then a 2nd app with a lower price point:</p>

<p>Documents <strong>Paid</strong> Ranking:
<a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Documents_Paid.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1130" alt="Documents_Paid" src="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Documents_Paid.png" width="930" height="699" /></a>
Documents <strong>Gross</strong> Ranking
<a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Documents_Gross.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" alt="Documents_Gross" src="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Documents_Gross.png" width="929" height="705" /></a>
Based on those data points, here’s a rough chart showing how much a Business app with X Gross Ranking is making:
<a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Business-Gross-Ranking-Chart.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1134" alt="Business Gross Ranking Chart" src="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Business-Gross-Ranking-Chart.png" width="580" height="423" /></a>
Naturally the more data points (apps) we add the more accurate the estimate will be.</p>

<p>Once we get enough data points, we’ll be able to comfortably estimate how much an app is making based on its Gross Ranking.</p>

<p><strong>2. Are the niche's keywords searched frequently? If so, how cluttered are the App Store search results (ASSRs)?</strong></p>

<p>This is a tough one because Apple doesn’t release keyword data. While there do exist tools now that approximate keyword search frequency, I didn’t know about them when I picked my niche. So this is what I did instead:</p>

<p>For each niche I brainstorm a bunch of keywords/phrases. I plug those words into the Google Keyword Tool and go with the “mobile only” option.</p>

<p>From there I select the top 30 or so KW phrases. And I plug <em>those</em> phrases into the search bar of the App Store.</p>

<p>Then I go through the ASSRs.</p>

<p>For the top 5 or 10 results for each KW I consider a few metrics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Does the app have a lot of reviews? How recent are the reviews?</li>
    <li>When did the developer last update the app?</li>
    <li>Are there any apps that make good money and only rank high in the ASSRs for a few KW’s?</li>
</ul>

<p>In an ideal world you’d find an app that has lots of reviews and that ranks well in the ASSRs for <em>one</em> KW, and of course is making money. That means the KW is likely to be something users are searching for.</p>

<p>If a profitable app ranks well for a few KW’s, look at the other apps in the ASSRs. Do they appear to be making money? The more money the top results are making, the more likely the KW is valuable.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful here though: some apps will rank well for many KWs and it requires much more detective work to figure out which KWs are the ones users are actually searching.</p>

<p><em>Is the keyword competitive?</em></p>

<p>Simply look at the # of apps in the ASSRs for the KW phrases research above.</p>

<p>E.g. below are the # of results for different KW’s with the word “calculator”:</p>

<p>“calculator” = 10,930
“tip calculator” = 777
“scientific calculator” = 336
“graphing calculator” = 81</p>

<p>I consider anything less than 100 to be great. Anything over 500 is probably too much.</p>

<p><strong>3. Are the competitors any good?</strong></p>

<p>You can look at reviews and quickly get a feel for what users do/don’t like about the app. Also just subjectively look at it: does it appear the developer is putting time/care/love into the product? Maybe she’s become apathetic because she has so little competition and users can’t find anything else.</p>

<p>If it looks like the competition isn’t trying very hard but they’re still making money, it’s likely you’ve found a niche worth investing some time in.</p>

<h1>And Finally…</h1>

<p>These three items can help make a decision about whether to create (or outsource) an app.</p>

<p>But <strong>be careful</strong> of falling into the trap of thinking some nich is going to reach out and shout at you, “This is the app to make!” In retrospect a profitable niche appears obvious, but when it’s first being built you’re never 100% sure. Sometimes you just have to build the thing to find out.</p>
