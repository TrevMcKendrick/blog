**Summary**  
Inside story of the 2012 presidential election.

**Details**  
Lots of great stuff, but here are a few highlights:

- The list of potential Republican candidates. It was fascinating that some men said they didn't run, even with tons of powerful support, because they were happy and satisfied with their current lives.
- Obama and Romney both expressing how much they dislike political debates. Seeing them talk you'd have no idea.
- How close Obama was to botching the 2nd debate even worse than the first. His practice runs the day before were terrible.
- Romney couldn't buy himself a break. While him and his team definitely made some mistakes, it seemed the worst possible consequences always followed. His team even had a phrase for it when Romney himself screwed up: "Mitt happens."
- The nature of Utah's beloved former Governor Huntsman: barely wealthy (net worth of $10 million), and super (but stupidly) political. Instead of banding with the more likely Mormon candidate, he turned on Romney as soon as he saw just a small personal benefit to doing so.

It appears the writers had great access, and the book's truthfulness has been vouched by some people in the book.

**Recommendation**  
If you enjoy politics and want to understand a bit more about behind the scenes you will likely enjoy this book. My only hesitation is that some parts seem a little embellished and exaggerrated. That said, it still gives you a look at events that weren't available to the public.
