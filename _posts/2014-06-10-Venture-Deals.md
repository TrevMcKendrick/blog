**One Sentence Summary**  
Advice on how to raise venture capital.

**Details**  
I didn't read this book as thoroughly as I do most. It probably serves better as a reference guide. 

I did read the whole thing to make sure I was at least somewhat familiar with everything mentioned. But really diving deep into the nitty gritty details will be much more useful if I ever decide to raise VC.

But some things that you can look forward to if you decide to read it:
- Detailed explanations of both control and economic terms found in term sheets
- Lessons on the economic incentives of venture capitalist funds, so as to decifer their at times bizarre behavior
- Negotiation lessons
- Info on the various stages of financing deals
- Common terms and things to watch out for on LOI's (Letters of Intent)

**Would you like it?**  
If you're into the tech scene and constantly read about valuations, seed rounds, acquistisions, hearing about employees getting screwed on their options, etc., this woudl be an interesting book to guide you through that universe.
