title: BackOffice Goes to Silicon Valley

---

Last weekend I had the chance to head out to Silicon Valley with a bunch of other Utah entrepreneurs (Chad Bennett, Ken Frei, Michael Zaro, Ryan Westwood, to name a few). We had a great trip, met some wonderful people and got to see some exciting places.

I'll just mention the highlights of the trip:

**Y Combinator**  
We started at Y Combinator and got a tour with YC partners [Kat Manalac](https://twitter.com/KatManalac) and [Garry Tan](https://twitter.com/garrytan). Kat did most of the tour and gave a quick rundown of YC. My favorite takeaway was how incredibly nice they both were. Not conscending or arrogant at all. Hopefully I'll run into them again at YC's Startup School in a few weeks.

**Ronnie Conway**  
Ronny Conway closed his [first fund focusing on Series A's](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/14/ronny-conway-closes-his-over-51-million-early-stage-fund/) back in Februrary. He has a new take on A rounds, part of which includes never taking a board seat. He was super nice and candid with our small group even though you could tell he was tired at the end of a long day. His fund's first deal was in Utah-based Weave (who also graduated from Y Cominbator).

**Google**  
We got a fun tour of Google's campus and yes, it's everything you imagined. 

My favorite part was was seeing one of Google's original servers (image below). 

They also had this fun thing called "All the President's Meng." It's an electronic board with rotating pictures of a particular Google employee (Chade-Meng Tan) and a *ton* of famous people. Here's a sample he has [on Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/photos/116358482624154197444/albums/5057423992178991505). Apparently he started at Google in 2000 and somehow has taken pictures with all the famous people that come through.

The best part about walking around Google is thinking about when it was just two guys working at Stanford.

**Gild**

What happens if you taught yourself to code, but you didn't go to school, you've never worked at a big company, and don't otherwise have any pedigree or credentials? How will people know to hire you?

[Gild](http://www.gild.com/) solves this by doing a ton of amazing data science on publicly accessable data: think open source repositories, social media accounts, etc. From all of that they can tell who are the best developers. It's pretty amazing.

**First Opinion**

First Opinion with McKay Thomas was probably one of my favorite stops. I had never met McKay, but I'd briefly heard of [First Opinion](http://firstopinionapp.com/) (and downloaded their app) when they launched in 2013.

McKay is an amazing storyteller; you can see why he was able to raise $40 million to sell baby clothes in Brazil, and now $2.5 for First Opinion (without anything more than a vision and a few mockups).

The guy is incredibly passionate and persuasive. I could have listened to him talk for another few hours.

**Giants Game + Sailing**  
The trip ended with a Giants game and a day of sailing.

After more than 3 hours of practically no wind, the last hour had some great wind and we were able to finish our races.

All in all a great trip. Excited to be back again soon.
