This is post #5 of my 8 post series on my first year in the App Store.

Conferences can be scary to attend. If you're like me and in a new industry, you might sometimes show up alone and without knowing a soul.

By way of example, in 2012 I attended Expolit, a conference focused on the Spanish Christian publishing industry. My goal was to get licensing rights to books and study guides to sell as in-app purchases inside our mobile apps.

Expolit is a conference for publishers and distributors to meet each other. It’s a tight-knit community. While I do speak spanish, I was *completely new* to the industry and didn't know anyone when I arrived to Miami. I remember walking into the hotel lobby and hearing everyone chatting loudly in Spanish, like it was some big family reunion. 

**Know Exactly What You Want**  
*Why are you at this conference?* is a really important question! If you don't have a solid answer, I'd think twice before shelling out all the money required to attend (hotel, flights, and conference tickets get really expensive, really fast).

You need to have specific strategic goals for the conference.

For me at Expolit, I wanted to meet the digital rights managers of every publisher in attendance. They're the people who could actually sign a contract with me to let me sell their books as ebooks inside my apps. 

I started with literally 0 contracts or licenses. So the goal was to start the process of licensing digital books to sell as in-app purchases inside my iPhone apps.

**Make Them Sell to *You***  
When I first arrived I walked in and immediately walked up to the publisher booths.

I energetically introduced myself and my app company, Salem Software. I told them our story, what we do (Spanish Bible apps), etc. Some people were nice and opened up, but lots of others kind of just listened and then didn’t ask any questions of their own. It felt like a really bad date.

A little later in the first day once I was more tired I found myself slowly walking by booths, gradually perusing everything inside the booth, rather that directly walking up to the booth manager. Sometimes I’d pick up an example book and thumb through it.

This changed *everything*.

Suddenly the publisher's employee was coming up to *me* and selling *me* on *their* products. “We just released a new book…” or “have you seen this…?” They were trying to convince me that I should carry their books, which is exactly what I wanted!

This was extremely powerful. Of course I wanted to hear what they had to say, so I’d eagerly listen and ask questions. When they were done I’d ask if I could tell them what we do, and they’d also happily say yes. 

And boom, I had an audience.

This was the perfect introduction. Instead of me approaching them overenthusiatically and scaring them away, I could build a relationship by genuienly listening to them first. By the end of those conversations we were great friends, with specific followup steps agreed to.

**Track your conversations**  
Anyone who has been to a conference knows you talk to hundreds of people and collect *way* too many business cards. By the end you look back at all those cards and can’t remember the person’s face, let alone all the details of your conversation.

So after every conversation I'd write down on the back of their card what we talked about, and what the next steps were.

And at the end of every night at my hotel room I'd transfer all of this to Google Docs. This is huge! ![title][2]

Now when I email people to followup I can refer to specific details from our conversation. 

I can mention who introduced us, where we met, which products we talked about, etc.

I can practically guarantee they will _not_ be doing the same tracking, so they’ll be reeling to remember who you are when they see your email. Helping them remember you as a human being who had a real conversation with them goes a long way torwards getting your email read.

**Experiment with your message**  
My initial story when I approached publishers was something along the following:

 _“We’re Salem Software and we make Bible study software for mobile devices. We focus 100% on native Spanish speakers because we believe they’re a neglected demographic. This is natural since most companies do English first, then Spanish as an afterthought. We also sell other Christian books and content in our mobile app store.”_

I got bored just rereading that.

About two sentences in I’d lost them. I thought they would care that we focused on Spanish speakers but I was wrong.

I started experimenting with the message, but ultimately it all came down to one line:

_“We do digital distribution.”_

Now they knew _exactly_ how we could work together and what I was looking for. More importantly: **they knew how I could benefit them**. 

If they had more questions about our business and who we are, great, but first and foremost they had the context for what we do.

**Stand out**  
Again, people are not going to remember you, so you must do your best to stand out.

This is really hard though as you must balance a fine line. If you’re new and try to stand out _too_ much you’ll look dumb and people won’t trust you.

Honestly for me all I had were [really nice, simple business cards](http://us.moo.com). As a first impressions they were much better than some of the business cards I received!

An even better example of standing out was something I saw from a little booth in the corner. Every person they had a decent conversation with, myself included, they’d take their picture with them.

When they followed up to me via email they attached the picture, and I _immediately_ remembered who they were and the conversation we had. It worked really well.

Now, taking a picture with everyone might be weird in some settings. Be careful. But do experiment and try finding something that works for your personality and your industry and then go with it.

**Be humble**  
I pride myself on speaking Spanish well. While I haven’t stayed as fluent as I’d like, I’m still pretty good and like to practice as much as I can. In some instances if I find the right person to talk to I can even “show off” by using idioms and expressions that most foreigners don’t know.

So when I arrived at the conference I _really_ wanted to speak Spanish the entire time. Some conversations went really well, but others I struggled to effectively communicate. On top of that, nearly every digital licensing rep I spoke to was bilingual anyway.

About halfway through I bit the bullet. Any person who I absolutely needed to get to know I’d speak to in English. They understood me and Salem Software better, and I felt more confident.

This was hard because I love speaking Spanish. I love impressing native speakers with all the slang that I know. But ultimately I had to eat some humble pie and stick to my mother tongue. If I hadn’t I wouldn’t have built the relationships necessary to achieve my goals.

**Break bread**  
The two people I had dinner with are the two I feel closest to after the conference. There’s something about eating together outside of a typical “work” environment that helps people loosen up. You don’t even have to drink (we didn’t).

If you're more experienced and already know a few people, another great strategy is to get a bunch of people (around 8-10) for dinner at a restaurant outside of the hotel. Pay for it yourself and be the host. This will not only connect you more closely to more people, but it will boost your personal brand. You'll be seen as someone with influence and relationships in the industry.

**After the Conferenece**  
Once the conference is over there are other things to keep in mind:

**Follow up**  
As the small company doing the asking it of course falls upon us to do all the follow up.

You want to do this soon after the conference but it doesn’t have to be immediately. Some people will still be recovering from the exhausting week away, or they’ll already be inundated with emails from other people they met.

I started emailing my new contacts 4 days after the conference. I don’t know if this was the perfect move vs emailing them _right_ after the conference, but it worked pretty well.

**Don’t worry if they’re slow**  
After emailing folks I didn’t hear back from many of them and kind of started freaking out. What if the entire conference was a waste!

Lo and behold, people at big organizations have a lot to do and can be a little slower to respond. No big deal.

For everyone that I hadn’t heard back from I sent another email a week later basically saying _“Hey I wanted to check in since I hadn’t heard from you. I hope you’re recovering from Expolit.”_

The next day I suddenly had a ton of emails waiting for me from all these big publishers. People’s answers all varied, between “I was still on vacation” to “I’ve still trying to get caught up from the conference.” Many even apologized!

The point is, don’t freak out if they don’t respond initially. And definitely don’t pester them with a bunch of emails asking what happened. Be emotionally mature and wait.

**Track your emails**  
For every contact in my Google Doc I also had a cell to keep track of where we were in the licensing process.

Have I emailed them? Have they responded? Have they sent me a contract? Etc. 

Without it I’d have to reread every email chain to remember who the person is, where we are in the deal, what they need from me, etc. This is a huge pain and I’m surprised a product doesn’t exist to solve it, but it’s so worth tracking.

**Stay in Touch**
After all the deals are over and your conference goals have been achieved, make sure to stay in touch! When the next conference comes around you'll know more people and be more confident. You'll be able to host a dinner and start to really build a brand in the industry.

Don't let those relationships go cold!
