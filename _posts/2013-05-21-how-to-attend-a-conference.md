title: How to Attend A Conference

Conferences can be scary to attend. If you're like me and in a new industry, you might sometimes show up alone and without knowing a soul.

By way of example, in 2012 I attended Expolit, a conference focused on the Spanish Christian publishing industry. My goal was to get licensing rights to books to sell as in-app purchases inside our mobile apps.

Expolit is a conference for publishers and distributors to meet each other. It’s a tight-knit community. While I do speak spanish, I was *completely new* to the industry and didn't know anyone when I arrived to Miami. I remember walking into the hotel lobby and hearing everyone chatting loudly in Spanish, like it was some big family reunion. 

**Know Exactly What You Want**  
*Why are you at this conference?* is a really important question! If you don't have a solid answer, I'd think twice before shelling out all the money required to attend (hotel, flights, and conference tickets get really expensive, really fast).

You need to have specific strategic goals for the conference.

For me at Expolit, I wanted to meet the digital rights managers of every publisher in attendance. They're the people who could actually sign a contract with me to let me sell their books as ebooks inside my apps. 

**Make Them Sell to *You***  
When I first arrived I walked in and immediately walked up to the publisher booths.

I energetically introduced myself and my app company, Salem Software. I told them our story, what we do (Spanish Bible apps), etc. Some people were nice and opened up, but lots of others kind of just listened and then didn’t ask any questions of their own. It felt like a really bad date.

A little later once I was more tired I found myself slowly walking by booths, gradually perusing everything inside the booth, rather that directly walking up to the booth manager. Sometimes I’d pick up an example book and thumb through it.

This changed everything.

Suddenly the publisher's employee was coming up to me and selling me on *their* products. “We just released a new book…” or “have you seen this…?” They were trying to convince me that I should carry their books!

Of course I wanted to hear what they had to say, so I’d eagerly listen and ask questions. When they were done I’d ask if I could tell them about what we do and they’d happily agree. 

And voilá, I had an audience.

This was the perfect introduction. Instead of me approaching them overenthusiatically and scaring them away I could start a small relationship by listening to them first. By the end of those conversations we were great friends, with specific followup steps agreed to.

**Track your conversations**  
Anyone who has been to a conference knows you talk to hundreds of people and collect *way* too many business cards. By the end you look back at all those cards and can’t remember the person’s face, let alone all the details of your conversation.

So after every conversation I'd write down on the back of their card what we talked about, and what the next steps were.

And at the end of every night at my hotel room I'd transfer all of this to Google Docs. This is really important. ![title][2]

Then when I email people to follow up I refer to the specific details from our conversation. 

I can mention who introduced us, where we met, which products we talked about, etc.

I can almost guarantee they will _not_ be doing the same tracking, so when they see your email they’ll be reeling to remember who you are and what you wanted from them. 

Helping them remember you as a human being who had a real conversation with them goes a long way torwards getting your email read.

**Experiment with your message**  
My initial story when I approached publishers was something along the following:

 _“We’re Salem Software and we make Bible study software for mobile devices. We focus 100% on native Spanish speakers because we believe they’re a neglected demographic. This is natural since most companies do English first, then Spanish as an afterthought. We also sell other Christian books and content in our mobile app store.”_

I got bored just rereading that.

About two sentences in I’d lost them. I thought they would care that we focused on Spanish speakers but I was wrong.

I started experimenting with the message, but ultimately it all came down to one line:

_“We do digital distribution.”_

Now they knew precisely how we could work together and what I was looking for. They understood how I could help them.

**Stand out**  
Again, people are not going to remember you, so you must do your best to stand out.

This is really hard though as you must balance a fine line. If you’re new and try to stand out _too_ much you’ll look naive and people might not trust you.

Honestly for me all I had were [nice, simple business cards](http://us.moo.com). As a first impression they were much better than some of the other cards I received.

But a better example of standing out was something I saw from a little booth in the corner. Every person that worker had a decent conversation with, myself included, they’d take their picture with them.

When she followed up to me via email she attached the picture, and so of course I immediately remembered who she was and the conversation we had.

Now, taking a picture with everyone might be weird in some settings. But do experiment with finding something that works for your personality and your industry.

**Be humble**  
I pride myself on speaking Spanish well. While I haven’t stayed as fluent as I’d like, I’m still quite good and like to practice as much as I can. In some instances if I find the right person to talk to I can even “show off” by using idioms and expressions that most foreigners don’t know.

So when I arrived at the conference I _really_ wanted to speak Spanish the entire time. Some conversations went really well, but others I struggled to effectively communicate. On top of that, many of the digital licensing reps I spoke to were bilingual anyway.

About halfway through I bit the bullet. Any person who I absolutely needed to get to know I’d speak to in English. They understood me and Salem Software better, and I felt more confident.

This was hard because I love speaking Spanish. I love impressing native speakers with all the slang that I know. But ultimately I had to eat some humble pie and stick to my mother tongue.

(That said, practically all of the Central and South American publishers I spoke to did not speak any English, so the Spanish thankfully still came in very handy.)

**Break bread**  
The two people I had dinner with at the conference are the two I still remember the most. There’s something about eating together outside of a typical “work” environment that helps people loosen up. You don’t even have to drink (we didn’t).

If you're more experienced and already know a few people, another great strategy is to get a bunch of people (around 8-10) for dinner at a restaurant outside of the hotel. Pay for the check and be the host.

**After the Conferenece**  
Once the conference is over there are other things to keep in mind:

**Follow up**  
As the small company doing the asking it of course falls upon us to do all the follow up.

You want to do this soon after the conference but it doesn’t have to be immediately. Some people will still be recovering from the exhausting week away, or they’ll already be inundated with emails from other people they met.

I started emailing my new contacts 4 days after the conference (it ended on a Friday, so the following Tuesday). I don’t know if this was the perfect move vs emailing them _right_ after the conference, but it ended up working working out fine. Unbeknownst to me at the time, many people use the conference to take an extended vacation in Miami, so they weren't even checking their email immediately after the conference.

**Don’t worry if they’re slow**  
After emailing folks I didn’t hear back from many of them and kind of started freaking out. What if the entire conference was a waste!

Lo and behold, people at big organizations have a lot to do and can be a little slower to respond. No big deal.

For everyone that I hadn’t heard back from I sent another email a week later basically saying _“Hey I wanted to check in since I hadn’t heard from you. I hope you’re recovering from Expolit.”_

The next day I suddenly had a ton of emails waiting for me from all these big publishers. People’s answers all varied, between “I was still on vacation” to “I’ve still trying to get caught up from the conference.” Many even apologized!

The point is, don’t freak out if they don’t respond initially. And definitely don’t pester them with a bunch of emails asking what happened. Just follow up consistently until you hear a yes or a no.

**Track your emails**  
For every contact in my Google Doc I also had a cell to keep track of where we were in the licensing process.

Have I emailed them? Have they responded? Have they sent me a contract? Etc. 

Without it I’d have to reread every email chain to remember who the person is, where we are in the deal, what they need from me, etc. This is a huge pain and I’m surprised a product doesn’t exist to solve it, but it’s so worth tracking.

**Stay in Touch**
After all the deals are over and your conference goals have been achieved, make sure to stay in touch! When the next conference comes around you'll know more people and be more confident. You'll be able to host a dinner and start to really build a brand in the industry.

Don't let those relationships go cold!
