Okay, so maybe you’ve decided: I want to be an entrepreneur. Or maybe you just want to make a couple extra bucks a month. The next question is always a hard one:

Where do I start?

And here’s the thing that every successful entrepreneur eventually realizes (heck, it took me forever to figure this out). And I pause to say this, because I don’t want to burst anyone’s bubble. But I really feel that transparency is so important:

There’s no 100% sure way to figure out what to do.

Which means:

You are going to make mistakes.

But that’s okay. That’s expected. The difference is that most of us have been trained our entire lives to avoid mistakes.

For example, if you make a mistake at your job you might get fired, right? So when you’re working for someone else (depending on the culture of the employer of course) you’re much less likely to try new things and experiment. You don’t want to make a mistake… and that’s okay! They don’t want you to mess up, either.

But entrepreneurship and working for yourself is a completely different beast.

Specificaly, there’s often no exact defined way to succeed. Of course, you can learn a lot from blogs like mine and others on the Internet. But do you think someone told Steve Jobs or Bill Gates how to make their companies? Or that they just always knew what to do? No way! They worked really hard, experimented, and made tons of mistakes.

And so what can we learn from them?
Their mistakes never broke them. Aka they didn’t bet their entire companies (or for people like me, their livlihoods) on one project or “big bet”. They took calculated risks so that if, say, an entire project didn’t work out, they could continue working.

Apple’s Power Mac G4 Cube is a great example of this. They built this great product that just didn’t sell. There’s lots of speculation as to why (e.g. was it too expensive?) but ultimately that doesn’t matter. Apple had to cancel it. I know for certain it wasn’t Steve’s first mistake, but it was one of his most public mistakes since he had become CEO of Apple.

You cannot learn without making mistakes. More specifically, you can’t start a new company without making some mistakes. They don’t even have to be big! But it’s going to happen. And that’s okay.

#Learning New Things
Remember the last time you learned something new (for some of us, myself included, it’s been a long time!). You can pick multiplication tables as a kid, learning to play an instrument, maybe learning a language. Or maybe cooking or some other hobby that you now enjoy.

I speak Spanish, so I’m going to use that as an example.

Have I always known how to speak Spanish? Duh, of course not. So what happened along the path between knowing nothing (literally being left Mexico and barely knowing how to count to 10), and speaking fluently today?

Of course I studied and practiced every day. And I went out and I talked to people. I tried to force myself to learn.

And what happened? Well, at first it wasn’t pretty. People were very nice, but they’d often treat me like a child (I was 19 at the time) because they didn’t understand me at all. And because I spoke so slowly, I often couldn’t get most of thoughts out before I was interrupted.

How discouraging!

Over time my daily practice and study helped, and I improved slowly but surely. It was hard to measure the progress day-to-day, but over a month or two looking back I could start to notice people treated me differently. They could finally understand me!

#All Learning Requires Mistakes
Now, if you went up to someone and asked them “do you think you can learn a new language without making mistakes?” they’d tell you “Of course not. That’s crazy.” And (spoiler alert!) they’re right! Of course you’D make mistakes when learning a new language.

It’s the exact same way with starting a business. Of course we’re all going to make mistakes along the way. That should seem obvious! But for some reason it’s not; like, we’re so afraid to do something because “oh what if I mess up?"

The reason we’re often so afraid of business mistakes is because, personally and as a culture, we treat learning a language (or playing an instrument, cooking, etc.) differently from learning to start a business.

Why?

It’s mostly because of money. People associate “business mistakes” with losing money.

The classic example  is starting a restaurant. You pay a bunch of money to prepare the restaurant, buy food, hire staff, etc., and then if it fails (i.e. you made a mistake) then you lose all the money you spent on the restaurant.

And for the most part that’s true. Some businesses, like restaurants, require a lot of upfront money, and so they're inherently more risky.

But that’s not true about a lot of other businesses. There are tons of opportunities available these days where you can take a calculated risk and try something out, on the cheap, way before you have to spend a lot of money like you would with a restaurant.

#My First App
For example, my first app cost only $500 to make. Of course $500 isn’t cheap, but compared to starting a restaurant or a retail store or basically *any business with a building and at least 1 employee*, $500 is a steal! So you don’t *have* to break the bank to try something out.

If I’d tried the app and spent my 500 bucks and it completely failed, I’d have been out 500 dollars. But by taking a calculated risk, that was okay! I knew that if I lost the $500, I’d be okay.

And, even more importantly, at least I tried! Most people are so terrified of the unknown that they won’t even put themselves out there, personally or financially. So I told myself hey, if this goes belly up and you don’t make a dime, at least you tried.

(I have to insert one of my favorite quotes here, by Hellen Keller:
"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing at all.”)

So I was totally fine with potentially making a small, calculated mistake.

#What About You?
You might read $500 and think “whoa, that’s a lot of money”. The good news for you is, fortunately, there’s plenty of businesses that require even less than that.

And maybe you read $500 and thought “oh hey, I can do that. How do I get started?” Which is great!

The most important part is realizing mistakes are part of learning, and that learning is part of starting a business. And, of course, mistakes can be calculated and controlled. There’s no reason whatsoever to bet the proverbial farm on something new!

If you can grok that, you’re emotionally ready to start your own business.
