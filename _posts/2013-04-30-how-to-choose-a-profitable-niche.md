This is post #2 of my 8 post series on my first year in the App Store.

**tl;dr We can estimate how profitable an app is using Gross and Paid Rankings. This helps us decide whether it’s a good niche to get into.**

## A Framework for Evaluating Potential Niches

When I was considering building my Spanish Bible app I wanted to be as sure as possible that people were going to be able to find it &amp; buy it. With that in mind I came up with the idea of the **ideal target niche.**

The ideal niche:  
**1. Is profitable**
**2. Can be found through search**
**3. Has crappy competitors**

Today I’m going to explain how to figure out #1.

**Step 1. Find an app that ranks #25 Paid**  
I found two apps in the Business category that have a history of ranking around #25 Paid. You can see their historical Paid rankings below via AppFigures:  

 [PDF Expert][2] ![title][3] [Documents][4] ![title][5] Why #25 Paid? See step 2.

**Step 2. Calculate the apps’ daily revenue using Distimo**   
Last year I asked the nice folks at Distimo to analyze how many downloads it takes an app to rank #25 Paid by category.

[Gert Jan Spriensma][6], a Distimo analyst at the time, was nice enough to respond with [this post][7] which got [picked up by TechCrunch][8].

You don’t even need to read the whole post, just this one chart: ![Downloads required to rank Paid #25, by category][9]

This means our two example apps **are being downloaded roughly 90 times a day.** We can **estimate their daily revenue** by multiplying their prices by 90. ![title][10]

**Step 3. Look up Gross Ranking**   
Easy with AppFigures: ![title][11]![title][12] Eyeballing the charts it looks like **their average Gross Ranks are #13 and #50**, respectively.

**Step 4. Plot the Data**    
This is what we’ve collected: ![title][13]

Plotting it we get this: ![title][14]

This gives us an estimate on **how much apps in the Business category make**.

**Conclusion**  
But estimating a niche’s profitability is only part 1 of the ideal niche. We want something that’s profitable **and** not swamped by competition.

In next Tuesday’s post I’ll write about how to pick a niche where users will find you via the best distribution channel of all – App Store search.
