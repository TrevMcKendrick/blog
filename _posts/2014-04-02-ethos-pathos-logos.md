I got into a small debate on Twitter a few weeks ago. To argue one of my points, I shared [a post](http://sivers.org/zipit) from the popular Derek Sivers. 

To counter my point, the other side referred to [a post](http://www.cdixon.org/2009/08/22/why-you-shouldnt-keep-your-startup-idea-secret/) from Chris Dixon. The other debaters also made the point that we could share posts from "big name" bloggers all day long and it wouldn't get us anywhere.

He assumed I was making an argument based on *ethos*, or the authority and expertise of the author.

In fact, I was using *logos*, or the logic of the post. It didn't matter who wrote it. That the post happened to be by someone who is internet famous was merely how I found it.

In addition to ethos (authority) and logos (logic), there's also *pathos*, or emotion.

I learned about ethos, logos, and pathos in English 101, but they still serve me well today. When someone is making a point, whether they know it or not, they are appealing to one of those three. And it's useful to be aware of which they're using.

For example: much of the frustration with our seemingly politically divided country might be attributed to the problem that the easiest content to consume is based on pathos (emotion). TV/radio sound bites and linkbait headlines are good examples of this.

Therefore many people are informed by mostly emotional arguments instead of rational ones.

Instead, if we recognize an emotional argument for what it is, we can look at the argument itself and analyze it on its merits.
