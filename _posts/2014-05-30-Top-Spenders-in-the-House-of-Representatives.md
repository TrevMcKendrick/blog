I was playing around with some of the data from [The Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/tools/expenditures/) about spending in the House of Representatives.

Just some interesting findings for fiscal year 2013:

**Which representative spent the most?**
Bill Pascrell, Jr.  $1,479,975.81 

**Who spent the least?**
